# Weather_Data_Machine_learning

Built a weather analyzer application which uses data from weather api.Preproceses the data-->converting data into required format using pandas
The output graph depicts the number of hours it rained from last year july to this year month of july on each day.

The next stage is to predict temperature of this year it might be based on previous year data using linear regression.
 More things would be updated soon....
